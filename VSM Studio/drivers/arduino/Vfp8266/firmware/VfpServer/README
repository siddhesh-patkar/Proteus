VFP (Virtual Front Panel) Server for ESP8266
============================================

This code allows an ESP8266 based WiFi module to be used as an IoT Co-Processor
for applications built with Proteus IoT Builder.

Capabilities include:
 - File Storage and http server for SVG front panels created with Proteus IoT Builder
 - Partial emulation of Arduino Yun bridge protocol to permit communication between AVR and ESP8266
 - Access to the ESP8266 filestore via the bridge FILEIO library.
 - End user configuration mode for initial setup of ESP8266 WiFi etc.
 - FTP server for uploading of application resource files from Proteus
 - AVRISP mode for ISP programming of AVR via WiFi from Proteus
 - Telnet based remote debugging console, allowing access to debug output from both the VFP Server and the AVR code.

It is based on the ESP8266 Arduino core 2.3.0 and also uses lightly modified code from the following 3rd party libraries.
